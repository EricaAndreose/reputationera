# ReputationEra

The project aims at exploring the oscillations in reputation that different artists face analyzing and comparing economic and cultural data. The project focuses on two case studies: Willem de Kooning and Gustav Klimt

### What's reputation?
By reputation we mean the economic and cultural value of the artist's figure, which is defined through his positioning in the art market, the number of studies and publications about him and the number of exhibitions.
