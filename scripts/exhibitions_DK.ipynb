    "### Complete list of De Kooning's one-man exibitions. \n",
    "In our research we considered also the number of exibitions and the venue of the exibitions as parameters in order to check whether the reputation of the artist has changed over the years. However, no complete dataset on artists' exhibitions was found. In order to get an idea on how many exibitions have been covered on catalogues, and, in particular, how many exhibitions are traced by bibliographic records on BnF and Gallica, we needed a \"ground truth\" to state if those sources of information could be somehow comprehensive. \n",
    "\n",
    "The case study is Willem de Kooning, since all data about exibitions are uploaded on the website of the Willem de Kooning Foundation. \n",
    "The result of the webscraping are shown here, with a total of 131 exhibitions, 79 possess a catalogue. \n",
    "\n",
    "In bibliography_DK.ipynb extraction from SPARQL endpoint of BnF and Google Books API has been done in order to get all bibliographic records on De Kooning - 31 of them are records on exhibitions. So 39% of exibitions with catalogue are present in that dataset, 23% of the total exhibitions are covered. There's also the need to say that the bibliographic records extracted do not concern only one-man shows, so they include further shows that are not present in the dataset reported here below. \n"
